# Introduction

## What is Unix

- The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user.

- The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the **operating system** or the **kernel**.

- Users communicate with the Kernel through a program known as the **shell**. The shell is a _command line interpreter_; It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel.

  
## Main Concepts

- **Kernel** -> The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.

- **Shell** -> The shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell are the most famous shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.

- **Commands and Utilities** -> There are various commands and utilities which you can make use of in your day to day activities. **cp**, **mv**, **cat** and **grep**, etc.

- **Files and Directories** - All the data of Unix is organized into files. All files are then organized into directories. These directories are further organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.
