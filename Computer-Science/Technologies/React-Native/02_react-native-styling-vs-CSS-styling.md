# React Native Styling vs CSS Styling

- Styling in React Native is **inspired by CSS**, but it's not equivalent!

- React Native in the end is all about **translating React components to native widgets**.

- These native widgets don't understand CSS. They have nothing to do with the web, HTML, or anything like that!
