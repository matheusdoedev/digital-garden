# Divide and Conquer

- Part of the trick of making a good divide and conquer algorithm is determining how a given problem could be separated into two or more similar, but smaller, subproblems.

### Divide and Conquer Methodology

1. Given a problem, identify a small number of significantly smaller subproblems of the same type.
1. Solve each subproblem recursively (the smallest possible size of a subproblem is a base-case).
1. Combine these solutions into a solution for the main problem.
