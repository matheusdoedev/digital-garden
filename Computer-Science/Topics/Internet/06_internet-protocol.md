# Internet Protocol

- Unlike TCP, **IP is an unreliable, connectionless protocol**.
- Ip doens't care wheter a packet gets to it's destination or not. Not does IP know about connections and port numbers.
- \*\*IP's job is too send and route packets to other computers.
- IP packets are independent entities and may arrive out of order or not at all.
