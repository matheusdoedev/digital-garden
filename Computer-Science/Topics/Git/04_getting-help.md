# Getting help

- There are three equivalent ways to get the comprehensive manual page (manpage) help for any of the Git commands:

```zsh
$ git <verb> --help

$ git help <verb>

$ man git-<verb>
```

- In addition, if you don't need the full-blown manpage help, but just need a quick refresher on the available options for a Git command, you can ask for the more concise "help" output with the `-h` option, as in:

```zsh
$ git add -h usage
```
