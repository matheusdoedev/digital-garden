## Encapsulation

- Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called **encapsulation**.

## Interface

- The **interface** of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? what does the function do? and what is the return value?

## Refactor

- Rearranging a program to improve fnction interfaces and facilitate code re-se--is called **refactoring**

## A development plan

- Is a process for writing programs

### Encapsulation and generalization process steps

1. Start by writing a small program with no function definitions
1. Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name.
1. Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.
1. Repeat steps 1-3 until you have a set of working functions
1. Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring

## docstring

- A **docstring** is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface.
