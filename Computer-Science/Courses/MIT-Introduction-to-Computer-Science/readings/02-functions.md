# Functions

## Function call

- A **function** is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation.
- When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements.

## Adding new functions

- A **function definition** specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.

```py
def print_lyrics():
    print "I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay."
    print "I sleep all night and I work all day."
```

- **def** is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition.

## Stack diagrams

- To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a **stack diagram**.
- Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the function each variable belongs to.
- Each function is represented by a **frame**.
- A frame is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it.
