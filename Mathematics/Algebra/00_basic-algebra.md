# Basic Algebra

## Terminology and Notation

- `A := B` indicates that the equality holds by definition of the notations involved.
- The notation `P = => Q` means that P implies Q. `If P, then Q`. For example, `x = 2 = => x² = 4`.
- The notation `P <=> Q` means `P = => Q` and `Q = => P`. `P if and only if Q`. For example `3x - 6 = 0 <=> x=2`.

## Commutative and Associative laws

- In particular, the Commutative and Associative Laws say that you can add a bunch of numbers in any order and similarly you can multiply a bunch of numbers in any order. For example, `(A + B) + (C + D) = (A + C) + (B + D), (A * B) * (C * D) = (A * C) * (B * D)`.

## Identity

- Is an equation which is true for all values of the variables which appear in it.
  1. `a * 0 = 0`
  1. `-a = (-1)a`
  1. `a(-b) = -ab`
  1. `(-a)(-b) = ab`

## The Laws of Exponents

- For `a ∈ IR / a > 0`:
  1. `a²a³ = (aa)(aaa) = a²⁺³ = a⁵`,
  1. `(a²)³ = (aa)(aa)(aa) = a^2*3 = a⁶`
  1. `a²/a³ = (aa)(aa)/(aa)(aa)(aa) = a^-1`

## Kinds of Numbers

- The **natural numbers** are `1,2,3,...`
- The **integers** are `...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...`
- The **rational numbers** are ratios of integers like `3/2, 14/99, -1/2`
- The **real numbers** are numbers which have an infinite decimal expansion like `√2 = 1.414213562373...`
- The **complex numbers** are those numbers of form `z = x + iy` where `x` and `y` are real numbers and `i` is a special new number called the imaginary unit which has the property that `i² = -1`. Every integer is a rational number (because n = n/1), every rational number is a real number, and every real number is a complex number (because x = x + 0i). A real number which is not rational is called irrational.

## Rational Numbers

- That a real number is rational if and only if its decimal expansion eventually repeats periodically forever.
  - `0.333...`
  - `2.83333`

## The Number Line

- The choice of two points (representing 0 and 1) on a line determines a correspondence between the points of the line.
- The correspondence is called coordinate system on the line. The line is called a number line.

- Every real number is either positive, negative, or zero (and no number satisfies two of these conditions),
- The sum of two positive numbers is positive
- The product of two positive numbers is positive.

## Interval Notation

- The open interval `(a,b)` or `]a,b[` is the set of all real numbers x such that `a < x < b`, and the closed interval `[a,b]` is the set of all real numbers x such that `a <= x <= b`. Thus x is in the set `(a,b) <=> a < x < b` and x is in the set `[a,b] <=> a <= x <= b`.
- x is in the set `(a, b] <=> a < x <= b`,
- `]a,b) <=> a <= x < b`,
- `(a,∞) <=> a < x`
- `(∞,a] <=> x <= a`
- `(a,b) U (c,∞) <=> either a < x < b or else c < x`
