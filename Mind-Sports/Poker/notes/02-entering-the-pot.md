# Entering the pot

- Your decision here determines much about how the rest of the hand plays out, and will likely depend upon three crucial factors:
  - Your hand strength,
  - Your position at the table,
  - Your opponents' action in front of you

## Starting hands groups

### Group I: Monsters

- **AA**, **KK**, **QQ** and sometimes **AKs**
- These are “monster” hands and should always be played, even from early and middle position or against an opponent’s raise.
- It is advantageous to play these hands very aggressively, so you should definitely raise when you have a monster. See a monster, raise it up.

### Group II: Very Strong Hands

- **JJ**, **TT**, **AKo**, **AQs**
- Nevertheless, you should play and raise with these very strong hands in the majority of cases.
- However, if there is a raise and a re-raise in front of you, you should be very wary that an opponent may have a better hand. You may consider folding.

### Group III: Speculative Hands

- Any pair from **99** to **22**, any ace with a kicker lower between a J and 9, any suited ace, two suited cards ranked 10 or higher (e.g. **QTs**), **KQ**, **KJs**, two cards of the same suit with a maximum gap of two ranks (e.g. **98s** and **97s**)

### Groupd IV: Weak/Trash

- All other hands are considered weak starting hands. They are trash. They are neither highly ranked, nor connected in any meaningful way.
