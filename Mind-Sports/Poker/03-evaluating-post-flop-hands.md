# Evaluating Post-flop Hands

- After the flop, hands tend to fall into three categories: “made hands”, “drawing hands” and trash.

## Made Hands

- A “made hand” is one that has improved significantly on the flop and has only a slight possibility of improving even further.
- The important part to note is that this is already a very strong – or “made” – hand.
- Made hands can themselves be separated into three groups:

### Monster hands

- Better than one pair on the flop

- Examples:
  - AJs on a flop AJ2r
  - 33 on a flop AK3d

### Very strong hands

- Very good one pair hands such as top pair with top kicker or an over-pair to the board

- Examples:
  - QQ on a flop T44
  - AKs on a flop AT4h

### Marginal hands

- These are hands like middle pair

- Examples:
  - AT on a flop of KT2s
  - JJ on a flop of Q83r
